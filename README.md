# Bluetooth-door-lock
A lock i made that opens with your phone using bluetooth, since i moved to live with two other ppl and the door had that universal key on it and i didnt feel like drilling a hole to install a full chonky lock.

This is how it looks like from the inside. Kind of an ugly mess, aesthetics were definetly not prioritized.

The brains of the operation. It looks messy but gets the job done.

A little switch to turn it off from the inside and a small push button to open the door from the inside so you dont have to use your phone everytime.

It is completly unnoticeable from the outside.

Until you look a litlle closer ðŸ‘€. A small toggle switch so the system doesnt have to be running while its not being used and eat up the battery. and a small connector for emergency use.

The battery i made in the previously mentionned emergency case. Should the system fail for any reason I can use this to unlock the door.
